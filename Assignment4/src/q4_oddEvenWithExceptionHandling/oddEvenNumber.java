//		        Ah, but what if the translation is not successful? In that case, the scanner does not 
//				advance past any input. The bad input data remains as the next thing to be scanned,
//				so the next iteration of the loop will fail just like the previous one--the loop will 
//				keep trying to read the same bad input over and over.
//				To prevent an infinite loop, you have to advance past the bad data so that you can get
//				to something the scanner can read as an integer. The code snippet below does this by calling input.next():
				
				scn.next();
				continue;
